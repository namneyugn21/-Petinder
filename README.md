## Progress and Disclaimer
Currently, we are working on the swiping page...<br>
In addition, we found out that it is very costly to host and deploy backend database for this project. Hence, in order to run the program, we have decided (for now) to run all of the neccessary database in each terminal, as well as the frontend side on a separate terminal.
