# **Petinder**

Petinder is an innovative web application designed to connect users with pets available for adoption at local shelters, offering a swiping experience similar to the popular Tinder app. Discover your perfect pet match with just a swipe!

## 🚀 **Project Updates**
We're currently focusing on developing the swiping interface, bringing the heart of Petinder to life. Please note that due to the high cost of hosting and deploying a backend database, we've opted to run all necessary databases locally in separate terminal instances, alongside the frontend. This approach is temporary, and we aim to streamline the deployment process in future updates.
